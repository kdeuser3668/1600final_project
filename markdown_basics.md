# Markdown Basics

In this section, you'll learn the fundamental syntax of markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write formatted text using plain text syntax. It's commonly used in GitHub for README files, documentation, and wikis.

## 1. Headers

Markdown allows you to create headers by using the `#` symbol followed by a space. You can use up to six levels of headers, from the largest (`#`) to the smallest (`######`).

### Example:
```markdown
# Header Level 1
## Header Level 2
### Header Level 3
#### Header Level 4
##### Header Level 5
###### Header Level 6
```

## 2. Lists

Markdown supports both unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered) lists.

### a. Unordered Lists: 
Use -, *. or + to create bullet points. 

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```
### b. Ordered Lists: 
Use numbers followed by a period to create ordered lists. 

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

## 3. Links
You can create hyperlinks in markdown by using square brackets [] for the link text and parentheses () for the URL.

### Example: 
```markdown
[GitHub](https://github.com)
```

## 4. Images
Images are similar to links but with an exclamation mark ! in front of the syntax.

### Example: 
```markdown
![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/images/logo.png)
```
## Next Steps
Now that you've learned the basic markdown syntax, you can start using it to create well-structured documentation on GitHub.
