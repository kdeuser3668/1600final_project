# Markdown Basics

In this section, you'll learn the fundamental syntax of markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write formatted text using plain text syntax. It's commonly used in GitHub for README files, documentation, and wikis.

## 1. Headers

Markdown allows you to create headers by using the `#` symbol followed by a space. You can use up to six levels of headers, from the largest (`#`) to the smallest (`######`).

### Example:
```markdown
# Header Level 1
## Header Level 2
### Header Level 3
#### Header Level 4
##### Header Level 5
###### Header Level 6
```
