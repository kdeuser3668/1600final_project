# Navigation within Markdown

In this section, we will explore how to create effective navigation links in Markdown. These links can be used to jump between different sections of the same document or to link to other files within your GitHub repository.

## 1. Internal Navigation (Linking to Sections Within the Same Document)

Markdown allows you to create links that navigate to different sections within the same file. This is particularly useful for long documents or tutorials where you want to allow readers to easily jump to different sections.

### How It Works:
Each header (e.g., `#`, `##`, `###`) in Markdown can be turned into an anchor link. The link will be based on the header text, but in lowercase and with spaces replaced by dashes.

### Example:
Let's say you have the following header in your document:

```markdown
